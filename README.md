Visually exploring data on climate change.

## Fictitious Scenario

An anonymous billionaire philanthropist wants to invest in clean technology to stave on the impending crisis. However, he wants his donations and investments to be used on initiatives that have the most impact and partner with some of the largest greenhouse gas emitting countries in the world. To target his assistance, I have been hired as a data scientist to collate and provide visualizations to highlight the problem and to present to a board of trustees that will make key decisions on how the money is used. Which countries are the biggest emitters? Which greenhouse gas should we focus on? What sectors should we target for investment and have the most impact. Are emissions from China really a growing problem? These are just some of the questions I left with after the initial meeting.
